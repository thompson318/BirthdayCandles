Who are you and what do you do?
I'm Stephen Thompson, I work part time as a Research Software Engineer at the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences(WEISS). At WEISS I am developing software to deliver augmented reality for surgery, primarily written in Python, but also in JavaScript and C++.
I am extremely keen to enable researchers to better utilise open source software to create open and reproducible science. Outside of my working hours I am an advocate for getting children coding, running a CodeClub and creating content to encourage involvement with computer science. 

What is your project?

Where did the idea come from?
I have always enjoyed making my children's birthday cakes, following in my mothers imaginative footsteps, with a firm belief that function is as important as flavour. In 2021 I had to make a cake for my 9 year old, however, due to COVID 19 I couldn't let him blow the candles out on a cake that other people might eat. Faced with the possibility of making him his own personal chocolate cake, I decided to create a virtual cake instead.

Why use Raspberry Pi?
The Raspberry PI provided a cost effective interface with analogue to digital converters needed to read the wind turbine voltages, along with sufficient computing power to serve the web application from within the cake itself.

Roughly how does it work?
