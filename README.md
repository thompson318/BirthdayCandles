Blow them out

This is an attempt to hook some inexpensive wind turnbines up to an anologue to digital converter (pimoroni explorer phat) and measure the voltages. If the voltage exceeds a threshold we blow out the candle. Inspired by the inability to blow out candles on an actual cake due to COVID 19.
